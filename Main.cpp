	Define an Order class with (customer) name, address, data, and
	vector<Purchase> members. Purchase is a class with a (product) name,
	unit_price, and count members. Define a mechanism for reading and
	writing Orders to and from a file. Define a mechanism for printing Orders.
	Create a file of at least ten Orders, read it into a vector<Order>, sort
	it by name (of customer), and write it back out to a file. Create another
	file of at least ten Orders of which about a third are the same as in the first
	file, read it into a list<Order>, sort it by address (of customer), and write
	it back out to a file. Merge the two files into a third using std::merge().
